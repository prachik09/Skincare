# Skincare
This is my first webtech based project using PHP,JS, HTML,CSS, Validation & AJAX 
The Quiz page has a speech to text option that autofills the prompt as the user speak.
The quiz outcome is generated using MCP (Model Concept Protocol) , the response for the selected checkboxes aswell as the typed or spoken prompt is generated using a using a custom/local API endpoint (/analyze_skin) for AI/MCP integration.
Dynamic checkboxes are generated from the  user fed responses.
The admin details should be added to the database directly to get access to the Admin dashboard.
Login & Register works on validation and ajax for any new user to register and existing users to login.
Only the admin can view places orders , have a dashboard to add ,update delete products,
The database is attached, have it setup in your phpMyadmin view the website.
